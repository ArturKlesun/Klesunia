This package was planned to be moved to a separate repository to reuse in storyspace project
But i kinda threw storyspace for a while

The package consist of useless classes a bit less than completely. The only really useful classes are:
- IModel
- Field
- Arr
- IComponent
- AbstractHandler
- Explain

// below arguably

- Combo/ComboMouse
- AbstractPainter
- ContextAction
