as states this article: https://dzone.com/articles/htmlcssjavascript-gui-java-0
desktop gui in java can be generated from html (it likely even can run javascript!)

it would be a lot of niciness if whole our gui was on html/javascript. it will make it possible to
port to shmidusic.lv, and even save the java project from legacy death
(it could still be used as offline version - with work with file system and stuff)

and we, at last, will be free from this pitiful Swing!


well, it sucks after all, it costs a ton of money


searching further the web!



Nya! see the WebViewSample.java, it's exactly what we need.
